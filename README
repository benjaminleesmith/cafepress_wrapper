== INTRODUCTION ==

CafePress Wrapper was built to create a portal for multiple CafePress basic stores.
The intent is to create a fully fledged site where all product browsing and searching
is done on the wrapper site, while selecting specific sizes/colors/etc, shopping
cart functionality, and checkout is all done normally on cafepress.com

Runs great on Heroku.

== TODO ==

* Write setup howto
* Remove rockclimbingshirts.com specific stuff and create generic pages
* Add store specific functionality with product lists
* Add tests
